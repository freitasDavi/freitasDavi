### Hello Guys

<!--
**freitasDavi/freitasDavi** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->
     
❗️  Hey I'm Davi Freitas da Silva, 23 from Brasil, Front-end Developer who loves Javascript and Typescript. Nowadays i am working with ExtJS and C#, but my intentions are to move to ReactJS and NodeJS, because those are the technologies that hooked me. I like games and Tv-shows, so maybe you can find some thematic repositories and game development studies😆.

   Here you can find my studies, bootcamps and courses repositories.
   
   There is a lot of React, but you can also find: 
   
   $ Typescript 
  
   $ React JS
   
   $ NodeJS
   
   $ React-native
   
   $ C#

Hope you enjoy what you find here.


🔊 If you want to talk with me, feel free to send me an email davi.frrs@outlook.com, we can work together or share knowledge 🤗 .
